Adts Library for TypeScript (stack, queue, list, tree, graph)

Essentially a library for abstract data types.

It can be included in Angular projects, as well as in any other type of project that uses TypeScript as a development language.

It implements

- Stack and DStack for LIFO logic access.
- Queue and DQueue for FIFO logic.
- List and DblList for accessing data in a List distribution.
- Tree for ordering an other kind of tree's operations.
- And Graphs directed or not.

Hope your feedback for revisions and so on.
